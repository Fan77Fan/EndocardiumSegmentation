## EndocardiumSegmentation phase 2
Segmentation of endocardium in 2D MR images


      ### Part 1: Parse the o-contours

    Using your code from Phase 1, add the parsing of the o-contours into your pipeline. Note that there are only half the number of o-contour files as there are i-contour files, so not every i-contour will have a corresponding o-contour.

    After building the pipeline, please discuss any changes that you made to the pipeline you built in Phase 1, and why you made those changes.


    ### Part 2: Heuristic LV Segmentation approaches

        #### 1) Letâ€™s assume that you want to create a system to outline the boundary of the blood pool (i-contours), and you already know the outer border of the heart muscle (o-contours). Compare the differences in pixel intensities inside the blood pool (inside the i-contour) to those inside the heart muscle (between the i-contours and o-contours); could you use a simple thresholding scheme to automatically create the i-contours, given the o-contours? Why or why not? Show figures that help justify your answer.

        #### 2) Do you think that any other heuristic (non-machine learning)-based approaches, besides simple thresholding, would work in this case? Explain
